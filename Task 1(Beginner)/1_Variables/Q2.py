'''
for = 4
In Python, keywords are special words that have predefined meanings
and are part of the language syntax (like for, if, while, class, etc.).
They're used to define the structure and rules of Python code,
so you can't use them as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).

If you try:
for = 4

you'll get:
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
because Python interprets for as the start of a for loop, not as a variable name.
